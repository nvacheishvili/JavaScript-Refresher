# JavaScript Refresher

This repository will take you through different lectures created for 
refreshing JavaScript skills.

It will have several branches that you can use to retrieve code for 
different lectures inside JavaScript Refresher Section

If you have an ability to run terminal directly inside your IDE, then click on 
play icon inside your terminal and it should give you logs for each console log 
we wrote inside the terminal. 
This will help you in understanding what happens when certain code blocks get executed.
If you have an editor that does not have a terminal inside it, 
then just open up your terminal, navigate to the root of the directory that has play.js file inside it
and run
```node play.js``` and you'll see the outputs inside your terminal
