//What is a rest operator?
/**
 * A function that takes in arguments and converts them to an array using rest operator
 * @param args - takes in as many arguments as user passes to it and converts it directly to an array using rest operator
 * @returns [] - returns an array
 */
const toArray = (...args) => args;

//will return an array even though, we do not pass in array, we pass in single values one by one, but its converted to an array using rest operator
console.log(toArray(1,2,3));

//spread operator is used to pull out elements from the array or an object
//rest operator is used to merge multiple elements into an array
