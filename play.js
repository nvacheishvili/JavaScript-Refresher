/*
What is a Promise?
A promise is an object that represents the eventual completion or failure
of an Asynchronous operation.
In other words, a promise can be used
to handle the results of an Asynchronous
operation, such as a network
request or a file read operation.
Promises have three possible states
pending, fulfilled, and rejected.
When a promise is created,
it starts in a pending state.
If the Asynchronous operation succeeds,
the promise will be fulfilled, and if
it fails, the promise will be rejected.

 * A function that uses fetch to get the results from Public GitHub API regarding the username that we passed in
 * Even though we don't actually use promises in this function, the function getUser takes a username parameter and
 * returns a Promise that resolves to the JSON data of a GitHub user fetched from the GitHub API URL.
 * The Promise is returned by the fetch function, which makes an HTTP request to the API URL and returns a Promise that resolves to a Response object.
 * The json method is called on the Response object to parse the response as JSON and return a Promise that resolves to the parsed JSON data.
 * Therefore, the function getUser relies on the Promise-based nature of the fetch function and
 * the json method to handle the asynchronous nature of the API request and response.

/**
 * This function getGithubUser takes a username parameter and
 * returns a Promise that resolves to the JSON data of a GitHub user fetched from the GitHub API URL.
 * Inside the function, a new Promise is created,
 * which takes two arguments: a resolve function and a reject function. These functions are used to either fulfill or reject the Promise.
 * The fetch function is called to make a request to the GitHub API URL, and the response is parsed as JSON using the json method.
 * If the data object returned by the API includes a message property with the value "Not Found",
 * the Promise is rejected with an error message "User not found". Otherwise, the Promise is resolved with the parsed data object.
 * The .catch() method is used to handle any errors that occur during the fetch request or JSON parsing, and it rejects the Promise with the error.
 * This function provides a way to handle errors in case the user is not found, and it uses Promises to handle asynchronous code.
 * @param username - username of a user about which we'd like to get information about
 * @returns {Promise<any>}
